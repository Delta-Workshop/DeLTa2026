                <h2>Description</h2>

                <p>Deep learning (DL) has significantly advanced artificial intelligence (AI) in the past decade. 
                This workshop focuses on proactively using deep learning theory to design principled practices and applications, 
                specifically aiming to unify and promote a clear research direction:</p>

                <p><em>How to design principles using falsifiable predictions of the properties of deep learning systems?</em></p>

                <p>Deep learning theory aims to explain neural networks (perfect memorization, extrapolating generalization, 
                benefits of depth, etc.), with carefully crafted assumptions and conditions. 
                However, current theories fall short of establishing sustainable and practical principles: 
                1) Significant gaps between assumptions and practices, being unable to reliably describe the real world; 
                2) Rapidly evolving AI paradigms (data-centric AI, foundation models, pre-training/fine-tuning, prompting, etc.) 
                quickly redefine research focuses of theory works.</p>

                <p>Consequently, an exclusive emphasis on post hoc explanations with assumptions not thoroughly validated 
                    in practice will limit the broader impact of the theory. Instead, we propose to <strong>actively design deep learning with theory</strong>. This is because: 
                1) Prevalent deep learning strategies have well-known limitations and challenges (hunger for data, intricate networks, heavy training, black-box models, etc.). 
                2) Contemporary deep learning practices largely remain an experimental art, necessitating considerable empirics and training costs at every design stage, including:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Data: acquisition, distillation (or condensation), augmentations.</li>
                    <li>Model: DNN architectures, model scaling-up, model compression.</li>
                    <li>Optimization: hyperparameters, landscape, training curves.</li>
                    <li>Generalization: out-of-distribution generalization, zero/few-shot learning.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These limitations become especially prominent with data or label scarcity, undefined inductive biases, and low signal-to-noise ratios (e.g. AI-for-Science). 
                Moreover, AI safety (robustness, interpretability, trustworthiness, etc.) is increasingly critical. Due to the complexity of AI behaviors, 
                heuristics and empirics are insufficient to predict and manage safety concerns. 
                Therefore, there is an unprecedented urgent need for theoretical frameworks that are capable of predicting safety properties of AI systems,
                and making inherently safer and reliable designs.</p> 

                <p>This workshop, "<strong>D</strong>esign D<strong>e</strong>ep <strong>L</strong>earning with Principles: from <strong>T</strong>heory to <strong>A</strong>pplications" 
                    (<strong>DeLTA</strong>), will center around the abovementioned challenges. 
                    We advocate that deep learning theory should go beyond explaining practice, and proactively engage in predicting and designing deep learning applications. 
                    We aim to bring together experts from deep learning theory and applications, spur discussions, and foster collaborations on two broad and transformative questions:</p>
                
                <p><strong>Q1:</strong> How to use current deep learning theory to predict and design deep learning systems?</p>
                <p><strong>Q2:</strong> How to develop a practical deep learning theory that is closely connected with applications?</p>
